# TameOS

### About

TameOS is a... minimal OS which has good features like:
- VGA terminal
- Color
- Multiboot support
- CPU(ID) info

### Requirements

To build TameOS, you need a:
- Linux box (or perhaps WSL)
- Bash shell
- i686-elf cross-compiler (not needed if you're host is i686, just change CC in build.sh)
- Virtual machine like QEMU

### Building TameOS

Once you have met requirements, execute build.sh (superuser access is not required).
If everything goes well, run QEMU with the TameOS ISO produces.
